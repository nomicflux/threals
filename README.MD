# Threals

The [Surreal Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number "Surreal Number") are both an elegant way of interpreting real numbers (and beyond), as well as a subset of [Combinatorial Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory "Combinatorial Game Theory") (CGT) for two players.

While there are ways of breaking most of the laws of CGT, one way which I had not encountered (at least in any detail) was that of adding extra players.  The Threals are meant to be an analysis of three-player combinatorial game theory, and this package is intended to be a calculator of sorts.  It is still in progress.

I have built a game, [Hexation](https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation "Hexation") to start gathering intuitions about 3-player CGT, as well as to play with neural networks. 

Note: This repo is going through an intense refactoring, as I add in caching and take it from the messy toy it started as to something a bit more engineered.  No guarantees that anything will work in the meantime; my apologies to to wide world of Threal research.
